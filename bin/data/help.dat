 <entry index="firststeps" title=" 2. First steps">    {i}These steps are only suggestions on how to start a new game. After some time, you will probably find a better way which will suit your needs.{/i}

{u}General tips{/u}

{b}1.{/b} When you start the game, the whole map is empty and covered by fog. It is recommended to first thing to do in new game to ask for bases in base to which you are currently docked. Select {b}Ask for bases{/b} from list of available orders. If you closed this list, you can show it with key {GameKey 12}.

{b}2.{/b} You may also ask for events in this same base. Each that "asking" action takes some game time but in exchange it gives you some reputation in the base. More information about reputation you can find in topic {i}4. Sky bases{/i}. It is always good to have high reputation in bases.

{b}3.{/b} At the beginning the best way to earn some money is by trading between bases of different types. Thus try to find two different bases near yourself and start trading between them. Some examples of good routes:

    {b}*{/b} Food (rations, raw) from Agricultural bases to other bases.
    {b}*{/b} Gunpowder from Industrial bases to other bases.
    {b}*{/b} Wood from Refinery bases to other bases.
    {b}*{/b} Ammunition from Military bases to other bases.

    Thus, if you find an Agricultural base near a Refinery, start travelling between them and transport Raw Meat from the Agricultural base to the Refinery. In the other direction, Andrae Seeds from the Refinery to the Agricultural base. Do not trade with Shipyard bases at the beginning: they don't produce anything, thus you may end up travelling with empty cargo space. Trading between bases raises reputation in them too.

{b}4.{/b} From start go to {b}Ship Info{/b} screen and set {b}Reduce fuel usage{/b} as a current ship upgrade. With time your ship will be use twice time less fuel for travel, which made it a lot cheaper and all other thing a lot more profitable.

{b}5.{/b} After finishing upgrading engine, upgrade ship hull size by one. Then find any {shipyard} base and install second engine. And of course, upgrade it that same like first. This allows you to not only travel faster, but also escape from stronger enemies or catch them faster in the battle.

{b}6.{/b} Select one base as your home base (best is probably Agricultural if you need food and drinks to live, otherwise select Industrial), and start working on maximize reputation there. The best place for that main base should have one short trading route (one of described above) and {shipyard} base for buying upgrades to the ship.

{b}7.{/b} Sources of money are (from the best to the worst): Trading -> Missions (especially when selected only money as reward for them) -> Crafting -> Combat with boarding enemy ships -> Only ship combat.

{b}8.{/b} {FuelName} is used as fuel for your ship and as money to trade. Don't allow it to go too low. The safe lowest limit when starting journey from a base, is around 500 {FuelName}. If you lose all fuel during fly, your ship will fall from the sky, and you die.

{b}9.{/b} Read other sections of this help, you can find a lot of useful information.

{b}10.{/b} If you have any questions, problems or suggestions about the game, please read {b}Get involved{/b} page in {b}About{/b} screen in the start menu of the game.

{b}11.{/b} Enjoy the game and try to find your own, better way to play :)

{u}Combat{/u}

{b}1.{/b} The fastest way to destroy enemy ship is to destroy one of its engines. If enemy is unarmored, set your Gunner order to {i}Aim for their engine{/i}. When enemy is armored, destroy they armor first by setting Gunner to {i}Fire at will{/i}.

{b}2.{/b} If the only weapon of enemy is battering ram, and you have installed gun, try to stay outside they attack range. Go closer to enemy ship until your gun will start shooting and then set Pilot order on {i}Keep distance{/i} and Engineer on {i}Full speed{/i}. If you are faster than enemy, you can end combat even without damage to your ship.

{b}3.{/b} Some factions will escape if you destroy weapon on theirs ships. This is useful if you meet a lot bigger ship than your.
</entry>
 <entry index="movement" title=" 3. Ship movement">{u}Undocking from or docking to bases{/u}

    Your ship starts docked to a base. To move it, you must first give order {b}&quot;Undock&quot;{/b} from the base, by clicking on {b}&quot;Undock&quot;{/b} button. To see other orders available for ship, press {GameKey 12} key (or first {GameKey 22} key for see game menu) for open Orders menu.
   Each docking operation cost some money, depending on your ship size (bigger ships have bigger docking cost) and your reputation in that base. Info about docking fee on the dock button shows the base cost (only ship size) of docking. The same is with staying longer in base: for each day you pay this same price as for docking. When you will undock from bases, you will be pay the docking fee. You can't undock from the base if your ship is overloaded or until you don't pay the docking fee. You can try to escape from the base without paying, but this always ends with losing some reputation in that base and sometimes even with your ship damage. To escape from the base click on {b}&quot;Escape&quot;{/b} button.
When you undocked from base, in this same menu, you can dock again.

{u}Traveling{/u}

   To move your ship, you must set it speed, have fuel (called {FuelName}, which works as money too), and someone from ship crew assigned to pilot and engineer role. To assign crew members to selected role, open ship info screen: press key {GameKey 11}, select desired crew member and give order. Your ship can't move if it is overloaded. {sentientships} members don't need to set Pilot and Engineer to fly, but more experienced crew members on these positions can give better bonuses than flying without them.
   Travel time depends on skills of Pilot and Engineer (current members on these positions) and selected ship speed. For {sentientships} if you don't have Pilot and or Engineer on duty, speed depends on "intelligence" of the ship: bigger ships are more "intelligent".
   Fuel cost of travel depends on selected speed (faster = more fuel usage) and each engine fuel usage installed on ship. You can check fuel usage for each engine on ship information screen.
   To move ship in desired direction, use (by default setting) keys on keypad. You may change which keys move ship in game options.
   Ship speed depends on engine power, engine damage, ship weight (with cargo) and a bit on Engineer and Pilot experience.
   With higher set ship speed, there is bigger chance that one of engines will be damaged. More experienced Engineer have better chances to prevent engine damage during fly.
   You may disable or enable selected ship engine in ship info screen. Press key {GameKey 11} then select engine from list and press button {b}Disable engine{/b} for turning it off or {b}Enable engine{/b} for turning it on. When you fly you must have at least one working engine (when you docked to base you can disable all engines).

{u}Events{/u}

   During travel, you may encounter various events. Some events may bring new options to orders (for example, attack on other ships) or take options away (for example, full docks in bases prevent docking to base). Most events exist by some time. You may also ask for events in bases in which you are docked. You can ask in every base once on 7 game days. To ask, press {GameKey 12} key and then select option {b}'Ask for events'{/b}. Each ask take 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered events depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more other bases). From time to time, you can meet friendly ship which you can ask for events too.

{u}Setting ship destination{/u}

   You can set your destination travel point on map by selecting map cell by left click on it. If you left-click on map cell where your ship is, you will open orders menu.
   If you have set travel destination, press key {GameKey 5} to auto travel by one map field. When you want to move further, you can press {GameKey 10} key then you be moving until you reach destination, combat happen, or you can't move any more (no pilot/engineer if required, too damaged engines, no fuel, etc.).
   When destination is not set, pressing key {GameKey 5} allow you to wait 1 game minute without moving.</entry>
 <entry index="bases" title=" 4. Sky bases">{u}General Information{/u}

    Sky Bases are places where you can trade items, repair ships, heal or hire crew members, get new missions or ask for other bases and events.

{u}Discovering new bases{/u}

   At game start, you know only one base. You can discover others by flying on it or by asking for other bases in current base. To ask, press {GameKey 12} key and then select option {b}'Ask for bases'{/b}. You can ask for other bases only once in each base. Each ask take 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered bases depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more other bases). From time to time you can meet friendly trader ship, which you can ask for bases too.
   As you fly near bases (you are in this same cell where base is), you discover they type, and then they will be colored on sky map (e.g. Agricultural bases are green). Unvisited bases are in default text color. Symbol of the bases on map represents the faction to which the base belongs.

{u}Reputation in bases{/u}

   You can gain or lost reputation with each base. Generally, you gain reputation when you interact with base (trade, repair ship, recruit new crew members, ask for events, etc.). You can check your reputation level in your list of known bases. If your reputation with base is low, you can't dock to that base. You gain (or lose) reputation twice times faster in your home base ship. You may check which base is your home base in ship info screen (press key {GameKey 11}). It is possible to change your home base anytime you are docked to base: it is standard cost is 1000 {MoneyName}.
   Reputation levels, starting from lowest: Hated, Outlaw, Hostile, Unfriendly, Unknown, Visitor, Trader, Friend, Well Known.

{u}Types of bases{/u}

   Each sky base have own type which determine what that base sells or buys and what other options base provide. All information about the bases types are based on default setting. If you change anything, please refer to your changes.

   More information about trading you may find in {b}Trading{/b} help topic and about installing new ship modules in {b}Repair/upgrade ship{/b} topic.</entry>
 <entry index="trade" title=" 5. Trading">{u}General info{/u}

   To buy/sell items from bases you must first dock to base and having assigned crew member to talking in bases. All bases buy all items, but which items are sold, depends on base type and your reputation in that base. With higher reputation more advanced items are available at base to buy.
   Prices in bases depends on skill {TalkingSkill} of assigned to trade crew member: with higher skill you can sell items for more and buy for less. Additionally, prices depends on your reputation in base. With high reputation you earn more or pay less for goods, new recruits or services.
   From time to time, base prices of items can change a little (raise or fall). Chance for change depends on size of base, and it is higher when you visit that base less often.
   Prices showed on trade screen are base prices, without bonuses or penalties from reputation and trader skill.
   The amount of items that bases offer and free space in bases depends on the bases' size. Big bases can have a maximum of 128 different items, medium 64, and small 32.

{u}Buying/selling items{/u}

   To buy/sell items from bases, open orders' menu (key {GameKey 12}) and then select option {b}Trade{/b}, you will see trading screen. Press the mouse button on the selected item to see all available options. If you choose to sell or buy the selected amount of item, you will see the new form with field to set the selected amount of the items to buy or sell. Also, on this form you will see how much you will have to pay when buying or gain when selling the selected amount of the items with all available bonuses (reputation and Trading skill of the trader). To buy/sell items you must have enough free cargo space on your ship ({i}&quot;money&quot;{/i} aka {MoneyName} needs free cargo space too).
   How much base can buy items depends on how much it has money. This amount can change with time (raise or fall). Chance for change depends on size of base, and it is higher when you visit that base less often. Bigger bases have more money than small.
   Same with buying items from bases: they have limited amount of items for sale. Bigger bases have more items than small. Additionally, from time to time amount of items change (going up or down). Chance for change depends on base size and raise when you visit that base less often.
   If you are selling to a base an item which you are not allowed to buy due to your reputation level, you will gain a bit more reputation with that sale than normal.

{u}Friendly traders{/u}

   From time to time you can meet friendly trader ship in space with which you can trade too. It is very similar to trade with bases, you need someone assigned to Talk in bases duty, etc.</entry>
<entry index="combat" title=" 6. Combat">{u}General info{/u}

   To start combat, you must first be in this same map cell where desired target is. Then, from orders menu, select option {b}Attack{/b}.
   Combat can start automatically if enemy ship spots your ship first and is faster than you. Your chance to see enemy first depends on your ship pilot and gunners {PerceptionSkill} skill and size of ships. If you have smaller ship than enemy, it is bigger chance that you spot them first. When combat starts, all resting crew members back on their positions and don't go to rest until combat ends, unless you order them to rest.

{u}Giving orders during combat{/u}

   In combat, first you must set crew members to selected position and give each order then press Enter for made one combat turn. Each combat turn takes 1 minute of game time. To set crew member to selected position, you have to left-click on column with crew member name at the selected position. To set order for selected position, left click on order column to select proper order.
If you give order to aim for selected part of enemy ship, your Gunners will be shooting as often as for precise fire, just chance on hit will depends on part of enemy ship. If selected enemy part will be destroyed, Gunners will be shooting in random part of enemy ship, as usual.
Order {b}'Aim for weapon'{/b} hits directly battering rams or turrets for guns.
   To escape from fight, you must set Pilot order on Escape, after few turns (depends on how far and fast enemy was) you should escape.
   Slow speed in combat helps your Gunners hit enemies but also helps enemies hit you. If you want to have more chances to evade enemy attack, set speed to full speed. That same is with Pilot orders: evade or escape order helps avoids attacks but also reduce your chance to hit enemies.
   Sign {b}&quot;plus&quot;{/b} after crew member name in combat orders menu means that this member know something about selected role (have suitable skill).
   Double sign {b}&quot;plus&quot;{/b} after crew name in combat orders menu means that this member has the highest skill needed for selected role.

{u}Possible combat orders{/u}

   What order can be given to crew member during combat, depends on the crew member position. For pilot available orders are:

{b}* Go closer{/b}: Go as close as possible to enemy ship. If enemy ship will start escaping, follow it. Reducing distance between ships in combat raise chance to hit in enemy ship, but also enemy will be had bigger chance to hit your ship.
{b}* Keep distance{/b}: Try to keep current distance between ships. Useful if you are fighting with enemy who have only battering ram against your guns. If enemy will try escape, you will follow it. If enemy will try to go closer, you will try escape.
{b}* Evade{/b}: Start evading maneuvers. This greatly reduce change to hit you by enemy ship but also reduce chance to hit enemy by your gunners.
{b}* Escape{/b}: Try to escape from combat. Chance on escape depends on your ship speed and skills of your pilot and engineer or for {sentientships} on ship size.

   Available orders for engineers are associated with changing ship speed: {b}All stop{/b}, {b}Quarter speed{/b}, {b}Half speed{/b} and {b}Full speed{/b}. When you move slower, you have bigger chance to hit enemy ship, but also it raises chance to enemy to hit you too. Rising speed helps not only evade enemy attacks but also escape from combat.

   For gunners available orders are:

{b}* Don't shoot{/b}: Don't shoot with selected gun. Useful especially with Harpoon Guns when you want to wait until enemy lose its armor.
{b}* Precise fire{/b}: Shoot less but more precise. Gunner will still shoot to random enemy modules or to armor if enemy ship has it, but there will be bigger chance to hit in enemy ship.
{b}* Fire at will{/b}: Fire more but less precise. As for {b}Precise fire{/b} order: gunner will shoot to random enemy modules or to armor if enemy ship has it.
{b}* Aim for their engine{/b}, {b}Aim for their weapon{/b}, {b}Aim for their hull{/b}: All this orders works similar: Gunner will be shooting as often as for {b}Precise fire{/b} but in selected parts of enemy ship. If enemy have more engines or weapons, it will be randomly selected to which one.

   If you send your character to boarding enemy ships, you will be able to give your boarding ship party member two types of orders:

{b}* Attack [enemy name]{/b}: Attack selected crew member of enemy ship.
{b}* Back to the ship{/b}: Remove selected crew member from boarding party and let him back to your ship.

{u}Boarding enemy ship{/u}

   When enemy ship (or your) is stopped by harpoon or battering ram, you can set boarding party to attack enemy ship crew directly. In the boarding menu, select which crew members you want to send to enemy ship. They start attacking enemy crew in next combat turn. If you want to remove crew member from boarding party, assign him (or her) to any combat position or send on break in ship info window. If enemy ship (or your) will escape during combat, all your boarding party members will be dead. Chance for hit during melee combat depends on attacker weapon skill (or {UnarmedSkill} skill, if not using weapon) and defender {DodgeSkill} skill (which can be reduced by worn armor). Damage depends on attacker weapon and his/her {StrengthName}, defender armor and damage type of weapon (impaling damage is best against unarmored targets, cutting is good for all and blunt is best against heavy armored targets). {naturalarmor} takes less damage in melee combat. {toxicattack} can be especially deadly in melee combat when they are attacking without weapons any members of factions which are not immune to diseases and lightly armored. If you assign self to boarding party, you will be able to give orders them during boarding (instead of giving orders to crew on ship). In that situation you can assign targets for boarding crew members or send them back to ship. If you want to back to give orders for ship, you must give self order {b}&quot;Back to the ship&quot;{/b}.

{u}Ships weapons{/u}

{b}*{/b} Gun are main source of damage in ship to ship combat. It needs crew member to operate and proper ammunition in ship cargo to shoot. Explosive ammunition do less damage than other types of ammunition, but it is easier to hit enemy with that type of ammunition. Piercing ammunition do more damage than other types of ammunition, but it is harder to hit enemy with it. Normal ammunition doesn't modify in any way chance to hit. Fire rate of a gun depends on its size: bigger guns shoots less often (sometimes even one shoot every few rounds).
{b}*{/b} Harpoon gun does only minimal damage, its main role is stop enemy ship. It works only on ships without armor (this which don't have any or have destroyed armor first) and it attacks range is smaller than normal gun. How long enemy ship will be stopped depends on harpoon gun, harpoon used as ammunition and size of enemy ship. Setting hit location for harpoon gun only change chance to hit.
{b}*{/b} Battering ram don't need operator to attack, it attacks automatically when enemy is in close range, and it always attacks only one per 2 combat rounds. You can't set hit location for battering ram too. Damage from battering ram in combat depends on it own type, speed of attacker ship and weight of attacker ship. Thus, first attack with battering ram from huge ships in combat can be very powerful. Additionally, battering ram will stop enemy ship for 1 round if enemy is unarmored (or have destroyed armor).

{u}Combat tips{/u}

{b}*{/b} Watch out on damage level for your ship hull and engine. If one of them will be destroyed, whole ship will be destroyed in explosion too, and you die.
{b}*{/b} If any ship module in your ship will be destroyed, it kills crew member which is in this module too. Destroyed turret destroys mounted gun too and kill gunner which operate it, destroyed cockpit kills pilot, cabin kills resting inside crew member and workshops worker.
{b}*{/b} If you don't have anyone assigned as a Pilot (unless you are one of {sentientships}), it is considered as a {b}&quot;Go closer&quot;{/b} order.
{b}*{/b} When you don't have anyone assigned as an Engineer, you can't change ship speed, unless you are one of {sentientships}.
{b}*{/b} You (or enemy) starts hitting other parts of ship after destroying armor.
{b}*{/b} {GunnerySkill} skill affects chance to hit with gun or harpoon gun in combat and {PilotingSkill} skill affect chance to evade enemy attacks.
{b}*{/b} Amount of loot from enemies depends on each enemy. Stronger enemies give more amount of {MoneyName}.
{b}*{/b} You can see detailed ship/crew/cargo/messages status during combat by pressing corresponding button. There you can give normal orders to crew (even starts repairing during combat) or dropping cargo.
{b}*{/b} When you destroy enemy ship with using of boarding party, you will get better loot from that ship.
{b}*{/b} Damage from weapon depends on level of damage itself and used ammo damage. If weapon is more damaged, it does less damage. It works for player ship and enemy ship weapons.
{b}*{/b} You can assign (during combat or outside combat) which ammunition to use with selected gun or harpoon gun in ship info screen. If you don't assign ammo to gun, gunner will be using first available ammo from cargo which works with selected gun.
{b}*{/b} On combat screen you can see only damaged modules. Progress bar show how much damaged is selected module (more damage = bigger progress).
{b}*{/b} Amount of information about enemy ship depends on distance to it. In close range, you can see detailed information about enemy ship modules. In any bigger range, only very general information.
{b}*{/b} After destroying enemy ship, you have small chance to lose some reputation with home sky base of enemy ship.
{b}*{/b} If you destroy ship from your faction, chance to lose some reputation with home sky base of destroyed ship is much bigger.
{b}*{/b} Info about amount of ammunition to selected gun show: Assigned ammo amount (if any ammunition is assigned to this gun) or all ammunition to this gun which you have in your ship cargo.
{b}*{/b} If combat takes too long, enemy will try to escape from it. How fast it happens depends on the aggressiveness of the enemy: more aggressive will be fight longer than others.
{b}*{/b} If you hover your mouse over each combat participant health bar in boarding screen, you can see his/her/its equipment.
{b}*{/b} Small guns shoots more often, thus they are better designed for destroying small enemy ships (harder to hit). Also, if you have less experienced gunners, it is better to use smaller guns and explosive ammo to get higher chance to hit.</entry>
 <entry index="crafts" title=" 7. Crafting">{u}Setting crafting orders{/u}

    To start manufacturing items, first you must have enough material, proper module installed on ship and proper tool in ship cargo or in designed crew member inventory. Then you must set proper crafting order in {b}Craft{/b} menu. During setting a crafting order, you can also assign a crew member to it. If you choose option "Assign the best worker", a crew member with the highest needed skill for the recipe will be assigned to it. If no one in the crew have desired skill, then your character will be assigned to the order. You can also select option "Don't assign anyone" and then give a crew member order to starts crafting from ship info screen. What ship module and which items are needed for crafting, you can check in crafting menu (key {GameKey 13}). If you don't have items or workplace needed for crafting, they will be written in red in selected recipe information. Each recipe have own crafting time after which item is created, but crafter gains experience in crafting skill each 15 minutes. If after creating item, you don't have enough materials or tools to craft next item, crew member going on break and crafting order is cleared.
   For crafting items you can set how many times you want to craft it. For studying items, you may select only workshop.
   Sign {b}&quot;plus&quot;{/b} after crew member name on the list of crew members when assigning them to the workshop in ship info screen or during setting a crafting order means that this member know something about selected crafting order (have suitable skill).
   Double sign {b}&quot;plus&quot;{/b} after crew name on the list of crew members when assigning them to the workshop in ship info screen means that this member has the highest skill needed for selected crafting order.

{u}Getting new crafting recipes{/u}

    At beginning of game, you know only few basic crafting recipes. To discover more, you must study item which crafting recipe you want to reveal. Studying works in similar way like normal crafting order: with two differences: studying always take one item to finish, and it is always executed in Alchemy Lab module. List of available study orders depends on items which you have in ship cargo. Studying items doesn't give any materials, only crafting recipe.
    Additionally, you can acquire crafting recipes in bases. Which recipes are available, depends on base type, known by you recipes and your reputation in the selected base. If you don't have option {b}&quot;Buy recipes&quot;{/b} in orders menu when docked to base, this mean you bought, know all, or your reputation is too low to buy available recipes in that base type.

{u}Deconstructing items{/u}

    Some items can be deconstructed to recover some materials used to create them. Each deconstruction takes place in an Alchemy Lab. Not all items can be deconstructed: especially this smallest can't. Generally, deconstruction take same amount of time like creating the item and in exchange it gives around 80% of materials used in creating process.

{u}Crafting tips{/u}

{b}*{/b} Crafter always use tool which he/she have currently equipped. If he/she doesn't have any equipped, he/she take it from own inventory or from ship cargo. You may set manually which tool to use by equipping it in crew member inventory screen.
{b}*{/b} Each tool have chance to be damaged during crafting. Chance on damage tool depends on tool and crafting skill.
{b}*{/b} Crafting skills and level of damage to workplace determine amount of manufactured items. More damaged modules causes less crafted items.
{b}*{/b} Each crafting module have separated crafting order. It means, you can produce few types of items (or few times this same item) in this same time, if you have few crafting modules installed on ship and all have assigned work orders and workers.
{b}*{/b} Better crafting recipes may require better crafting tools.
{b}*{/b} The quality of crafted item depends on the crafting skill of the assigned crew member, the difficulty of the crafting recipe and quality of used crafting tools and materials. Especially materials have a large impact on the quality.

<entry index="repair" title=" 8. Repair/Upgrade ship">{u}Self repair of ship{/u}

   To start repairing ship, you must assign crew member to repair duty. If you don't have available {b}'Repair'{/b} order, it means, you don't have materials needed for repair module. You may assign more than one crew member or give order to repair for whole crew. Each additional member assigned made repair faster. Each damaged (or destroyed) module need specific material to repair and repair tools for each member assigned to repair duty. You can check which material is needed in {i}ship info{/i} screen. Ship is repaired every 15 minutes of work of assigned crew members. Speed of repairs depends on skills of assigned crew. You can check which skills are used in ship info screen.

{u}Repair ship in bases{/u}

   Additionally, you can buy repairs of ship in bases. Available options depend on size of base. In all bases you can select one module to repair or order slow repair of whole ship. In medium bases, you can order normal repair of whole ship and in large bases, fast repair. Normal and fast repairs cost more {MoneyName}. Base cost of repair depends on how much damaged is module and price of repair material in selected base.
   Cost of repairs is much lower in {shipyard} type bases.

{u}Upgrading ship modules{/u}

   To start upgrading ship modules you must first set which module you want to upgrade. You can do this in {i}ship info{/i} screen. Each module may have upgraded durability and some modules have additional options to upgrade (for example, guns have option to upgrade damage). If there are no options to upgrade selected module, you reach maximum allowed upgrade level for this module. To upgrading you need materials (it is that same material which is needed for repair module), repair tools in your ship cargo (or designed crew member inventory) and set crew member order to upgrade the module. At this point it starts slowly upgrading selected ship module. Each upgrade take some time and materials.
   Speed of module upgrade depends on skill of assigned crew member (it is this same skill which is used to repair module). Additionally, better skill of assigned crew member can reduce material usage for ship modules upgrades.
   You can always change which module and what is upgrading on it. If you change module to upgrade, all your progress is saved and can be continued later. If you change only what to upgrade (for example, from damage to durability) you will lose all previous upgrade progress.
   You can always stop current module upgrade. It doesn't cause any loses to upgrade progress, you can resume upgrade at any time.
   Each upgraded module gains some weight. Amount of gain depends on base module weight, its durability and upgrade type.

{u}Installing or removing ship modules{/u}

   In {shipyard} bases you can install new modules or remove old from ship. Availability of the modules to install depends on your reputation in the selected base. Each installation/removing take some time. Installation cost {MoneyName}, removing modules gives you {MoneyName}. There are some limitations to installation/removing modules: you can only replace ship hull module, you can have only one armor, cockpit, battering ram module installed on your ship. If you want to replace armor, cockpit or battering ram, first you must remove old module from ship.
   How much you get {MoneyName} from removing module depends on damage to selected module. If is it destroyed, removing will take only time and give no {MoneyName}.
   Each ship hull have maximum module space and maximum allowed size of module, which limit what and how many modules can be installed on it. Armor and weapons don't count to this limit. Most of basic modules use only one module space, but this most expensive modules, may use a lot of space. You can check how much each module space use on the {i}ship info{/i} screen or in the {i}shipyard{/i} screen in bases.</entry>
 <entry index="crew" title=" 9. Ship crew">{u}Hunger and thirst{/u}

    Depending on your character faction (selected at starting game), you and your crew must eat and drink. If you don't have food or drink on board, your crew will slowly die from dehydration or starvation. Amount of reduced hunger/thirst depends on consumables: more expensive consumables can restore more.

{u}Morale{/u}

   Every crew member (except this from {nomorale} factions) have morale. When he/she resting, he/she slowly gaining it (only when morale level is low), every time when he/she back to work, he/she losing a bit of morale. Same with giving orders: giving new orders except resting, reduce morale a little. Very high level of fatigue causes morale lost either. If member morale is very low, he/she may refuse to obey orders. Low morale reduces crew member loyalty too. If crew member loyalty will be low he/she stop obey orders and may leave your crew anytime you dock to base. In other way, high morale raises crew member loyalty.
   If crew member can't find food or drink when he/she is hungry or thirsty, will be losing morale too. Some consumed food and drinks can affect morale either.
   Each crew member must be paid. It may be daily payment: constant value of {MoneyName} paid on new day or percent of profit from selling items in bases or to traders (at least 1 {MoneyName} per sale). If you don't have enough {MoneyName} to pay or your profit from the sale is too low, unpaid crew member will lose morale.
   When your crew member die, you will stay with his/her body in your ship cargo. At this moment, you can only drop that body from cargo. Additionally, all other crew members lose some morale.
   How fast crew member gains or lose morale depends on level of morale too: With higher level it gains and lose slower than when his/her morale is low. {fanaticism} members gains morale faster and lose it much slower.

{u}Tiredness{/u}

   Every member of crew (except this from {nofatigue} factions) getting tired when have assigned order other than {b}On break{/b} or {b}Talking in bases{/b}. When member is too tired, he/she stops working and going rest (only outside combat). After rest, if his/her previous position is vacant (e.g. nobody is piloting ship), he/she automatically back to work if no other crew member on that position.
   To assign selected crew member to position, select it from list by left click and then left click again on member order to select other.

{u}Health{/b}

    Crew members can regenerate health over time but only when they are on break and have assigned cabin. Additionally, if you have proper healing tools in cargo, you can assign other crew member to heal wounded. Assigning crew members in {b}Ship Info{/b} screen, don't assign that member to medical room (if you have any installed). To assign medic to medical room, you have to go to {b}Ship info{/b} screen. It can greatly speed up recovering (speed of healing depends on healing skill of healer). Having installed {b}medical room{/b} on ship speed up healing too. Only fully healed members can be healer. If you don't have any healing tools on ship, you can heal wounded crew members in bases. Cost of healing depends mostly on price of healing tools in selected base. In {temple} bases, healing is twice times cheaper than in other types of sky bases. Healing tools and healing skill needed for healing wounded, depends on faction of wounded crew member.

{u}Training skills{/u}

    You may train selected crew member in any skill in bases. Each training session takes 60 minutes and gives some experience in trained skill and associated attribute. Cost of training depends on skill level. Gained experience depends on associated attribute. You can choose what should limit amount of the training sessions in school: amount of training sessions or maximum amount of {MoneyName} used for training. The minimum cost for training shows cost for one training session in the exact moment. As the crew member can gain level in the selected skill during training, each session can cost a lot more than this value. Thus, limiting the training by the amount of {MoneyName} is safer and will not end in using all the money. Also, during training skills in bases, you don't need training tools, only {MoneyName}.
    Additionally, if you have installed any training room module on your ship, you can train skills there. First, you must set which skill you want to train in this training room in {b}Ship Info{/b} screen. Which tools are needed for each skill, you can check in {b}Ship Info{/b} screen too. Then give selected crew member order to training. Training skills on ship require proper tools which depends on the crew member skill level. Higher skills require better tools. Information about the selected skill show information about the worst needed tool for training. You can use better tools also.

{u}Orders priorities{/u}

   Each crew member can have set orders priorities. {b}Highest{/b} priority means that this crew member will be stopping current work and go on selected order if that position is needed and vacant. {b}Normal{/b} priority means that this crew member will take selected position when he/she is on break if that position is needed and vacant. {b}None{/b} means that this crew member will be ignoring selected position if that position is needed and vacant.
   To set orders priorities, click button {b}'Set orders priorities'{/b} and select priority, then left click on priority level to change it.

{u}Various info{/u}

{b}*{/b} If crew member cabin is destroyed (or don't have any) and he/she going on break, he/she will try to find empty cabin as a new own to rest.
{b}*{/b} Speed of rest of crew members depends on quality, damage level and cleanliness of cabin which they owned. Without cabin, they rest very slow.
{b}*{/b} If your ship is docked to base, you can dismiss crew members. Go to ship info screen and use {b}Dismiss{/b} option on selected crew member. Dismissed crew members joins to base population. Dismissing crew member little reduces morale of rest of crew (if they are not from {nomorale} factions).
{b}*{/b} Hunger, thirst, wounds, very low and very high morale (except for members of {nomorale} factions) have impact on your crew members skills. Wounded or hungry crew members have penalties to their skills.
{b}*{/b} When crew member start working on duty which needs any tool (like crafting, cleaning, upgrading or repairing ship) he/she takes needed tool to own inventory and equipping it if he/she doesn't have proper tool equipped. You can manually set which tool he/she should use in inventory screen.
{b}*{/b} Each crew member have maximum encumbrance for inventory which depends on his/her {StrengthName}.
{b}*{/b} Crew members skills levels, starting from lowest: {i}Beginner, Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner, Competent, Respected, Renowned, Master, Grand-Master, Legendary, Ultimate{/i}.
{b}*{/b} Crew members attributes levels, starting from lowest: {i}Very low, Low, Below average, Average, Above average, High, Very high, Outstanding{/i}.
{b}*{/b} Each skill is associated with one attribute. It means that real skill level is sum of skill level and associated attribute level. Gaining experience in skill cause gaining experience in associated attribute too. Attributes level grows much slower than skills levels. Additionally, if you gain experience in any skill, you gain experience in {ConditionName} too.
{b}*{/b} If contract of crew member will end, he/she will be treated like passenger (you can't give orders to that crew member anymore) and will leave your ship in next not abandoned base to which you dock. Until this, you must still feed him/her with food and drinks.</entry>
 <entry index="missions" title="10. Missions">{u}Starting missions{/u}

    You can ask for missions in bases where you have reputation level Unknown or above. Each base offers different missions: they amount depends on base size (in bigger bases you can get more missions) and on player reputation in that base (better reputation, more missions available). To see what missions are available in selected base, first you must dock to it then select option {b}Missions{/b} from {b}Orders{/b} menu (key {GameKey 12}). How many missions you can accept in base, depends on your reputation: with higher level, you can get more missions. You may reduce amount of money for reward for selected mission in exchange to earn more reputation in base. But one warning: if you fail that missions, you will lose more reputation either. To do this, move slider in the {b}Accept Mission{/b} dialog to the left. If you want more money but less reputation for mission, move slider to the right.
   {b}Note:{/b} Information about estimated time to achievement (ETA) and approximately fuel usage is based on your ship full speed and fuel consumption by your engines. It may be different from final usage and time spend on the mission.

{u}Some details about different types of missions{/u}

{b}* Deliver items{/b}: you don't need to dock to base to finish this mission, you can select proper order before docking. But you must have someone assigned to 'Talk in bases' position. Additionally, deliver missions gives reputation to both bases (base where mission started and base where mission ended).
{b}* Transport passengers{/b}: generally similar to {b}Deliver items{/b} missions: gives reputation to both bases, etc. Passengers are special crew members: you can't assign them to work, you can't change they cabin. They need food and drinks during transport. Same as normal crew members they can die during combat if they cabin will be destroyed. Each passenger always demands whole cabin for self.
{b}* Patrol{/b} or {b}Explore area{/b}: If you were attacked by enemy during exploring or patrolling, after fight you need to patrol or explore area again (again select proper order from {b}Orders{/b} menu).
{b}* Destroy ship{/b}: Same as {b}Patrol area{/b}: if you were attacked by other ship during searching for target, first you must finish this fight before you can start search again. If you escape from fight with mission target, you have been needing to search for it again.

   To finish mission, you must fly to map cell where mission target is and from {b}Orders{/b} menu (key {GameKey 12}) select proper order (for example, for patrol missions, you must select order {b}'Patrol area'{/b}). After some game time mission will be finished (for {i}delivery{/i} or {i}transport passengers{/i} missions) or ready to finish (any other type of missions). In second case, you have to back to base from which you accepted mission to receive reward for it. When you arrive at the base, by default you will automatically finish the mission by the most of the time. Auto finish will not work only when you don't have a Trader assigned or when there is a Double Price event in the base. You can also enable or disable auto finish missions in the 'Game Options' menu (key {GameKey 19}).
   Amount of {MoneyName} for a mission depends on distance which you must fly to complete mission, type of mission and amount of free space in your ship cargo. Additionally, same as in trading, final award for finishing missions depends on assigned as trader crew member skill {TalkingSkill} and your reputation in the base. If you don't have free space in cargo ship, you don't get reward for mission.
   Amount of reputation gained for finished mission or lost for failed mission depends on (same as amount of money) distance you must fly to complete mission and type of mission.
   If you successfully finish mission, your character gain some morale, if you fail, he/she will lose some morale.

{u}Various info{/u}

{b}*{/b} Red color of the mission name in {i}Transport passengers{/i} missions in the {b}Available Missions{/b} list means you don't have installed cabin with that quality or higher on ship. Yellow means you have cabin with that quality or higher, but it is taken by someone else.

    You can hire new crew members in bases. First you must dock to base, then you choose {b}Recruit{/b} option from {b}Orders{/b} menu. Amount of available recruits depends on size of base, but in some bases ({barracks}) there are more recruits, and they are cheaper. They hire cost and future payment, depends on amount of knowledge (amount of skills and attributes and levels of skills and attributes) and equipment. Skills, amount of skills, attributes and equipment quality of recruits depends on your reputation in selected base, but from time to time, you can find very experienced recruits in bases too.

{u}Negotiating employment{/u}

{b}*{/b} Starting morale of recruit depends on player reputation in selected base, except members of {nomorale} factions.</entry>
 <entry index="knowledge" title="12. Knowledge screen">{u}General info{/u}

    On the knowledge screen you can find important information about the world which your character found during the game. By clicking with the mouse on any entry there, like base, event or mission, you can bring more information about the selected entry with buttons for actions related to that entry. If the entry in a list is colored on yellow (with default the game settings), the entry is your ship destination.

 {u}Known bases list{/u}

    The list presents all known for your character bases. To fill the list, when docked to the base, select option {b}Ask for bases{/b} from {b}Orders{/b} menu. You can ask for bases in each base only once. To known more about the selected base, you have to visit it, by flying to it and dock there. If you visited the base, its entry on the list will be colored (with default the game settings) on green. Unvisited bases use default color. Over time this list can only grow, you will never lose any information about bases.

 {u}Known events list{/u}

    The list presents all known for your characters events which currently take place in the game. To fill the list, when docked to the base, select option {b}Ask for events{/b} from {b}Orders{/b} menu. You can ask for events from time to time in each base. The time when you can ask again, you can check in the base's information dialog in the list of known bases. The colors of the events are the same as for the events on the map.

One tip: during combat with an undead ships, it is good to send the boarding party on the enemy ship. After combat, they may find an interesting thing which will start something interesting.</entry>
 <entry index="reputation" title="13. Reputation with factions">{u}General info{/u}

  The game progress is measured by your reputation with factions. Depending on how you deal with them, your reputation will grow or decline. Additionally, each faction has friends and enemies. When you gain a reputation in some faction, you also gain a reputation among its friends but lose among its enemies. You gain reputation with factions in the same way as you gain reputation among bases. When you gain or lose reputation in a base, your reputation also changes with the faction to which the base belongs. Reputation with factions grows much slower than reputation with bases. You can check your current reputation levels in the {i}ship info{/i} screen.

 {u}Reputation effect{/u}

  The level of reputation with factions determines which NPC ships you encounter along the way. The lower your reputation, the more powerful opponents you will encounter. With a higher reputation, you have a chance to meet better traders of a given faction.
 </entry>
 <entry index="tips" title="14. Tips">{b}*{/b} All shortcuts from game menu works on map screen too, even when game menu is hidden. For example: you can always see help by press {GameKey 19} key on sky map (no need to press {GameKey 22} first to show menu).

{b}*{/b} You can reduce how long disease affect selected base by delivering medicines to it. What exactly medical supplies are needed depends on faction which belongs base. If you select to deliver supplies for free, you can gain some reputation otherwise, you gain {MoneyName} and may lose some reputation. The amount of gained or lost reputation depends on how many medical supplies you gave or sold.
{b}*{/b} What enemy you meet depends on how much upgraded ship you have: especially on upgrades of hull, armor, weapons and type of ammo. At beginning of game you can meet the weakest enemies, with every ship upgrade you meet stronger. Of course, there is always small chance that you encounter enemy stronger than you.
{b}*{/b} Each enemy can be different: very often enemy ships have some modules upgrades installed (stronger version of weapon, more durability, etc.).
{b}*{/b} Which orders are available for crew members, depends on orders prerequisites. For example, if you don't have set any crafting order set, you can't assign crew member to manufacturing.
{b}*{/b} Your ship gets dirty at the start of every day. You can send as many crew members as you want to clean the ship or give an order to the whole crew. It is the only order which don't give any experience to assigned crew members. You need any type of bucket to execute this order.
{b}*{/b} A base's population may change with time. Don't be surprised when a small base may be abandoned after a successful attack on it or after disease. A base's population may grow with time.

{b}*{/b} Abandoned bases may be recovered by someone. In that situation, they gain a small population and a new owner.
{b}*{/b} You may move most items (with except of items needed for missions) between ship cargo and crew members inventory in ship info screen and from inventory to ship in selected crew member inventory screen.
{b}*{/b} Enemies during combat can send boarding parties to your ship too, so when you are caught by a harpoon or battering ram, you caught an enemy by your harpoon or battering ram, don't forget to set someone to defends ship.

{b}*{/b} The maximum amount of items to sell or buy from bases or traders may be different from equal comparison between amount of {MoneyName} while will be used or gain and amount of items which will be sold or bought. The reason is that the maximum amount is count with all bonuses for the prices. When you buy or sell more items in bulk, you will get a better price for them. From the other side, buying or selling more often gives you more experience and reputation.
{b}*{/b} The quality of items affects their chance of damage. Poor quality items are more susceptible to damage when used, while high quality items are less likely to damage.</entry>
