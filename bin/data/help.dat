{u}Ship info{/u}
    On most screens you can see information about the required crew positions in the top right corner. First icon is for pilot, second - engineer, third - gunner, fourth - trader, fifth - repairs, sixth - upgrading ship modules, seventh - ship cleaning, and eighth - manufacturing.
   For pilots and engineers: if their letter is green, the position is taken by a crew member, and if it's red you don't have anyone assigned to this position.
For gunners and manufacturing: A green icon means all positions are taken (all guns, all crafting modules), a red icon means you have free positions (not all guns/crafting modules are taken), and a white icon means you don't have or need anyone assigned to this position. For {sentientships} a yellow icon means that you don't have anyone assigned to that position, but you don't need anyone either.
For repairs, upgrading ship modules, trader and cleaning ship, green means you have someone assigned to this position, red means you don't have anyone on that position but need someone, and a white icon means you don't have anyone assigned to this position and you don't need anyone.</entry>
 <entry index="firststeps" title=" 2. First steps">    {i}These steps are only suggestions on how to start a new game. After some time, you will probably find a better way which will suit your needs.{/i}
{u}General tips{/u}
    1. When you start the game, the whole map is empty and covered by fog. It is recommended to first thing to do in new game to ask for bases in base to which you are currently docked. Select {b}Ask for bases{/b} from list of available orders. If you closed this list, you can show it with key {Gamekey 14}.
    2. You may also ask for events in this same base. Each that "asking" action takes some game time but in exchange it gives you some reputation in the base. More information about reputation you can find in topic {u}4. Sky bases{/u}. It is always good to have high reputation in bases.
    3. At the beginning the best way to earn some money is by trading between bases of different types. Thus try to find two different bases near yourself and start trading between them. Some examples of good routes:
* Food (rations, raw) from Agricultural bases to other bases.
* Gunpowder from Industrial bases to other bases.
* Wood from Refinery bases to other bases.
* Ammunition from Military bases to other bases.
Thus if you find an Agricultural base near a Refinery, start travelling between them and transport Raw Meat from the Agricultural base to the Refinery. In the other direction, Andrae Seeds from the Refinery to the Agricultural base. Do not trade with Shipyard bases at the beginning - they don't produce anything, thus you may end up travelling with empty cargo space. Trading between bases raises reputation in them too.
    4. From start go to {i}ship info{/i} screen and set {i}Reduce fuel usage{/i} as a current ship upgrade. With time your ship will be use twice time less fuel for travel, which made it a lot cheaper and all other thing a lot more profitable.
    5. After finishing upgrading engine, upgrade ship hull size by one. Then find any {shipyard} base and install second engine. And of course, upgrade it that same like first. This allow you to not only travel faster, but also escape from stronger enemies or catch them faster in the battle.
    6. Select one base as your home base (best is probably Agricultural if you need food and drinks to live, otherwise select Industrial), and start working on maximize reputation there. Best place for that main base should have one short trading route (one of described above) and {shipyard} base for buying upgrades to the ship.
    7. Sources of money are (from the best to the worst): Trading -> Missions (especially when selected only money as reward for them) -> Crafting -> Combat with boarding enemy ships -> Only ship combat.
    8. Read other sections of this help, you can find a lot useful information.
    9. Enjoy the game and try to find your own, better way to play :)
{u}Combat{/u}
    1. Fastest way to destroy enemy ship is to destroy one of its engines. If enemy is unarmored, set your Gunner order to {i}Aim for their engine{/i}. When enemy is armored, destroy they armor first by setting Gunner to {i}Fire at will{/i}.
    2. If the only weapon of enemy is battering ram and you have installed gun, try to stay outside they attack range. Go closer to enemy ship until your gun will start shooting and then set Pilot order on {i}Keep distance{/i} and Engineer on {i}Full speed{/i}. If you are faster than enemy, you can end combat even without damage to your ship.
    3. Some factions will escape if you destroy weapon on theirs ships. This is useful if you meet a lot bigger ship than your.
</entry>
 <entry index="movement" title=" 3. Ship movement">{u}Undocking from bases{/u}
    Your ship starts docked to base. To move it, you must first give order {b}&quot;Undock&quot;{/b} from base, by clicking on {b}&quot;Undock&quot;{/b} button. To see other orders available for ship, press {GameKey 14} key (or first {GameKey 26} key for see game menu) for open orders menu.
Each docking operation cost some money, depending on your ship size (bigger ships have bigger docking cost) and your reputation in that base. Same is with staying longer in base - for each day you pay this same price as for docking. Undocking from bases is free. You can't undock from the base if your ship is overloaded.
When you undocked from base, in this same menu, you can dock again.

{u}Traveling{/u}
To move your ship, you must set it speed, have fuel (called {FuelName}, which works as money too), and someone from ship crew assigned to pilot and engineer role. To assign crew members to selected role, open crew menu - press key {GameKey 13}, select desired crew member and give order. Your ship can't move if it is overloaded. {sentientships} members don't need to set Pilot and Engineer to fly, but more experienced crew members on these positions can give better bonuses than flying without them.
   Travel time depends on skills of Pilot and Engineer (current members on this positions) and selected ship speed. For {sentientships} if you don't have Pilot and or Engineer on duty, speed depends on "intelligence" of the ship - bigger ships are more "intelligent".
Fuel cost of travel depends on selected speed (faster = more fuel usage) and each engine fuel usage installed on ship. You can check fuel usage for each engine on ship information screen.
To move ship in desired direction, use (by default setting) keys on keypad. You may change which keys move ship in game options.
Ship speed depends on engine power, engine damage, ship weight (with cargo) and bit on Engineer and Pilot experience.
With higher set ship speed, there is bigger chance that one of engines will be damaged. More experienced Engineer have better chances to prevent engine damage during fly.
You may disable or enable selected ship engine in ship info screen. Press key {GameKey 11} then select engine from list and press button {b}Disable engine{/b} for turning it off or {b}Enable engine{/b} for turning it on. When you fly you must have at least one working engine (when you docked to base you can disable all engines).

{u}Events{/u}
   During travel you may encounter various events. Some events may bring new options to orders (for example, attack on other ships) or take options away (for example, full docks in bases prevent docking to base). Most events exists by some time. Events on map are marked with mark {b}'?'{/b}. You may also ask for events in bases in which you are docked. You can ask in every base once on 7 game days. To ask, press {GameKey 14} key and then select option {b}'Ask for events'{/b}. Each ask take 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered events depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more other bases). From time to time, you can meet friendly ship which you can ask for events too.

{u}Setting ship destination{/u}
   You can set your destination travel point on map by selecting map cell by left click on it. If you left click on map cell where your ship is, you will open orders menu.
If you have set travel destination, press key {GameKey 5} to auto travel by one map field. If you want move further, you can press {GameKey 10} key - then you been move until you reach destination, combat happen or you can't move anymore (no pilot/engineer if required, too damaged engines, no fuel, etc.).
If destination is not set, pressing key {GameKey 5} allow you to wait 1 game minute without moving.</entry>
 <entry index="bases" title=" 4. Sky bases">{u}General Information{/u}
    Sky Bases are places where you can trade items, repair ships, heal or hire crew members, get new missions or ask for other bases and events.

{u}Discovering new bases{/u}
   At game start, you know only one base. You can discover others by flying on it or by asking for other bases in current base. To ask, press {GameKey 14} key and then select option {b}'Ask for bases'{/b}. You can ask for other bases only once in each base. Each ask take 30 minutes of game time. Amount of discovered bases depends on current base size (in larger bases they know more other bases). From time to time you can meet friendly trader ship, which you can ask for bases too.
As you fly near bases (you are in this same cell where base is), you discover they types and then they will be colored on sky map (e.g. Agricultural bases are green). Unvisited bases are in default text color. All bases marked on map as {b}'o'{/b}.

{u}Reputation in bases{/u}
   You can gain or lost reputation with each base. Generally, you gain reputation when you interact with base (trade, repair ship, recruit new crew members, ask for events, etc.). You can check your reputation level in your list of known bases. If your reputation with base is low, you can't dock to that base. You gain (or lose) reputation twice times faster in your home base ship. You may check which base is your home base in ship info screen (press key {GameKey 11}). You may change your home base anytime you are docked to base - it base cost is 1000 {MoneyName}.
Reputation levels, starting from lowest: Hated, Outlaw, Hostile, Unfriendly, Unknown, Visitor, Trader, Friend, Well Known.

{u}Types of bases{/u}
   Each sky base have own type which determine what that base sells or buys and what other options base provide. All information about the bases types are based on default setting. If you change anything, please refer to your changes.
- Industrial (red color): Produces tools and materials for crafting things. Generally you may bring here items produced in other bases types and buy here metal plates or tools. Not available for Drones faction.
- Agricultural (light green color): Produces food and drinks and buy other things. It is good idea to buy here food and drinks and sell them to other types bases.
- Refinery (blue color): Produces refined metals and buy other things. Perfect to create trade route with industrial base.
- Shipyard (light blue color): don't produce anything they only buys everything. But in this base you can install or remove modules from your ship. Not available for Drones faction.
- Military (green color): Produces ammunition to guns, weapons and armors for melee combat and buys other things. Same as refinery it is perfect start for trade route with industrial base.

Additionally, in this base you can install or remove modules from your ship. Depends on your luck, it can be good or bad place to start any trade route.
More information about trading you may find in {b}Trading{/b} help topic and about installing new ship modules in {b}Repair/upgrade ship{/b} topic.</entry>
 <entry index="trade" title=" 5. Trading">{u}General info{/u}
    To buy/sell items from bases you must first dock to base and having assigned crew member to talking in bases. All bases buy all items, but which items are sold, depends on base type.
Prices in bases depends on skill {TalkingSkill} of assigned to trade crew member - with higher skill you can sell items for more and buy for less. Additionally, prices depends on your reputation in base. With high reputation you earn more or pay less for goods, new recruits or services.
From time to time, base prices of items can change a little (raise or fall). Chance for change depends on size of base and it is higher when you visit that base less often.
Prices showed on trade screen are base prices, without bonuses or penalties from reputation and trader skill.

{u}Buying/selling items{/u}
   To buy/sell items from bases, open orders menu (key {GameKey 14}) and then select option {b}Trade{/b}, you will see trading screen. Select desired material to buy/sell, then select did you want sell or buy them. Next, enter amount of items which you want to buy or sell and press button. If you want to sell all owned items of that type, just select button {b}Sell all{/b}. To buy/sell items you must have enough free cargo space on your ship ({i}&quot;money&quot;{/i} aka {MoneyName} needs free cargo space too).
How much base can buy items depends on how much it have money. This amount can change with time (raise or fall). Chance for change depends on size of base and it is higher when you visit that base less often. Bigger bases have more money than small.
Same with buying items from bases - they have limited amount of items for sale. Bigger bases have more items than small. Additionally, from time to time amount of items change (going up or down). Chance for change depends on base size and raise when you visit that base less often.

{u}Friendly traders{/u}
   From time to time you can meet friendly trader ship in space with which you can trade too. It is very similar to trade with bases, you need someone assigned to Talk in bases duty, etc.</entry>
<entry index="combat" title=" 6. Combat">{u}General info{/u}
   To start combat, you must first be in this same map cell where desired target is. Then, from orders menu, select option {b}Attack{/b}.
Combat can start automatically if enemy ship spots your ship first and is faster than you. Your chance to see enemy first depends on your ship pilot and gunners {PerceptionSkill} skill and size of ships. If you have smaller ship than enemy, it is bigger chance that you spot them first. When combat starts, all resting crew members back on their positions and don't go to rest until combat ends, unless you order them to rest.

{u}Giving orders during combat{/u}
   In combat, first you must set crew members to selected position and give each orders then hit space for made one combat turn. Each combat turn take 1 minute of game time. To set crew member to selected position, left click on proper position (like Pilot, Engineer, etc) and then left click on column with crew member name. To set order for selected position, first left click on proper position, then again left click on order column to select proper order.
If you give order to aim for selected part of enemy ship, your Gunners will be shoot as often as for precise fire, just chance on hit will depends on part of enemy ship. If selected enemy part will be destroyed, Gunners will be shooting in random part of enemy ship, as usual.
Order {b}'Aim for weapon'{/b} hits directly battering rams or turrets for guns.
To escape from fight, you must set Pilot order on Escape, after few turns (depends how far and fast enemy was) you should escape.
Slow speed in combat helps your Gunners hits enemies but also helps enemies hits you. If you want to have more chances to evade enemy attack, set speed to full speed. That same is with Pilot orders - evade or escape order helps avoids attacks but also reduce your chance to hit enemies.
Sign {b}&quot;plus&quot;{/b} after crew member name in combat orders menu means that this member know something about selected role (have suitable skill).
Double sign {b}&quot;plus&quot;{/b} after crew name in combat orders menu means that this member have highest skill needed for selected role.
Sign {b}&quot;minus&quot;{/b} after crew member name in combat orders menu means that this member have assigned position (as a gunner, pilot, etc.).

{u}Possible combat orders{/u}
What order can be given to crew member during combat, depends on the crew member position. For pilot available orders are:
- {b}Go closer{/b}: Go as close as possible to enemy ship. If enemy ship will start escaping, follow it. Reducing distance between ships in combat raise chance to hit in enemy ship but also enemy will be have bigger chance to hit your ship.
- {b}Keep distance{/b}: Try to keep current distance between ships. Useful if you fighting with enemy who have only battering ram against your guns. If enemy will try escape, you will follow it. If enemy will try go closer, you will try escape.
- {b}Evade{/b}: Start evading maneuvers. This greatly reduce change to hit you by enemy ship but also reduce chance to hit enemy by your gunners.
- {b}Escape{/b}: Try to escape from combat. Chance on escape depends on your ship speed and skills of your pilot and engineer or for {sentientships} on ship size.
Available orders for engineers are associated with changing ship speed: {b}All stop{/b}, {b}Quarter speed{/b}, {b}Half speed{/b} and {b}Full speed{/b}. When you move slower, you have bigger chance to hit enemy ship but also it raise chance to enemy to hit you too. Rising speed helps not only evade enemy attacks but also escape from combat.
For gunners available orders are:
- {b}Don't shoot{/b}: Don't shoot with selected gun. Useful especially with Harpoon Guns when you want to wait until enemy lose its armor.
- {b}Precise fire{/b}: Shoot less but more precise. Gunner will still shoot to random enemy modules or to armor if enemy ship has it but there will be bigger chance to hit in enemy ship.
- {b}Fire at will{/b}: Fire more but less precise. As for {b}Precise fire{/b} order: gunner will shoot to random enemy modules or to armor if enemy ship has it.
- {b}Aim for their engine{/b}, {b}Aim for their weapon{/b}, {b}Aim for their hull{/b}: All this orders works similar: Gunner will be shoot as often as for {b}Precise fire{/b} but in selected parts of enemy ship. If enemy have more engines or weapons, it will be randomly selected to which one.
If you send your characted to boarding enemy ships, you will be able to give your boarding ship party member two types of orders:
- {b}Attack [enemy name]{/b}: Attack selected crew member of enemy ship.
- {b}Back to ship{/b}: Remove selected crew member from boarding party and let him back to your ship.

{u}Boarding enemy ship{/u}
When enemy ship (or your) is stopped by harpoon or battering ram, you can set boarding party to attack enemy ship crew directly. In the boarding menu, select which crew members you want to send to enemy ship. They start attacking enemy crew in next combat turn. If you want to remove crew member from boarding party, assign him (or her) to any combat position or send on break in crew info window. If enemy ship (or your) will escape during combat, all your boarding party members will be dead. Chance for hit during melee combat depends on attacker weapon skill (or {UnarmedSkill} skill, if not using weapon) and defender {DodgeSkill} skill (which can be reduced by worn armor). Damage depends on attacker weapon and his/her {StrengthName}, defender armor and damage type of weapon (impaling damage is best against unarmored targets, cutting is good for all and blunt is best against heavy armored targets). {naturalarmor} takes less damage in melee combat. {toxicattack} can be especially deadly in melee combat when they attacking without weapons, members of factions which are not immune to diseases and lightly armored. If you assign self to boarding party, you will be able to give orders them during boarding (instead of giving orders to crew on ship). In that situation you can assign targets for boarding crew members or send them back to ship. If you want to back to give orders for ship, you must give self order {b}&quot;Return to ship&quot;{/b}.

{u}Ships weapons{/u}
* Gun are main source of damage in ship to ship combat. It need crew member to operate and proper ammunition in ship cargo to shoot. Explosive ammunition do less damage than other types of ammunition, but it is easier to hit enemy with that type of ammunition. Piercing ammunition do more damage than other types of ammunition, but it is harder to hit enemy with it. Normal ammunition doesn't modify in any way chance to hit. Fire rate of a gun depends on its size - bigger guns shoots less often (sometimes even one shoot every few rounds).
* Harpoon gun does only minimal damage, it's main role is stop enemy ship. It works only on ships without armor (this which don't have any or have destroyed armor first) and it attack range is smaller than normal gun. How long enemy ship will be stopped depends on harpoon gun, harpoon used as ammunition and size of enemy ship. Setting hit location for harpoon gun only change chance to hit.
* Battering ram don't need operator to attack, it attack automatically when enemy is in close range and it always attack only one per 2 combat rounds. You can't set hit location for battering ram too. Damage from battering ram in combat depends on it own type, speed of attacker ship and weight of attacker ship. Thus first attack with battering ram from huge ships in combat can be very powerful. Additionally, battering ram will stop enemy ship for 1 round if enemy is unarmored (or have destroyed armor).

{u}Combat tips{/u}
* Watch out on damage level for your ship hull and engine. If one of them will be destroyed, whole ship will be destroyed in explosion too and you die.
* If any ship module in your ship will be destroyed, it kill crew member which is in this module too. Destroyed turret destroys mounted gun too and kill gunner which operate it, destroyed cockpit kills pilot, cabin kills resting inside crew member and workshops worker.
* If you don't have anyone assigned as a Pilot (unless you are one of {sentientships}), it is consider as a {b}&quot;Go closer&quot;{/b} order.
* When you don't have anyone assigned as a Engineer, you can't change ship speed, unless you are one of {sentientships}.
* You (or enemy) starts hitting other parts of ship after destroying armor.
* {GunnerySkill} skill affects chance to hit with gun or harpoon gun in combat and {PilotingSkill} skill affect chance to evade enemy attacks.
* Amount of loot from enemies depends on each enemy. Stronger enemies gives more amount of {MoneyName}.
* You can see detailed ship/crew/cargo/messages status during combat by pressing corresponding button. There you can give normal orders to crew (even starts repairing during combat) or dropping cargo.
* When you destroy enemy ship with using of boarding party, you will get better loot from that ship.
* Damage from weapon depends on level of damage itself and used ammo damage. If weapon is more damaged, it do less damage. It works for player ship and enemy ship weapons.
* You can assign (during combat or outside combat) which ammunition to use with selected gun or harpoon gun in ship info screen. If you don't assign ammo to gun, gunner will be using first available ammo from cargo which works with selected gun.
* On combat screen you can see only damaged modules. Progress bar show how much damaged is selected module (more damage = bigger progress).
* Amount of information about enemy ship depends on distance to it. In close range, you can see detailed information about enemy ship modules. In any bigger range, only very general information.
* After destroying enemy ship, you have small chance to lose some reputation with home sky base of enemy ship.
* If you destroy ship from your faction, chance to lose some reputation with home sky base of destroyed ship is much bigger.
* Info about amount of ammunition to selected gun show: Assigned ammo amount (if any ammunition is assigned to this gun) or all ammunition to this gun which you have in your ship cargo.
* If combat takes too long, enemy will try to escape from it. How fast it happens depends on the aggressiveness of the enemy: more aggressive will be fight longer than others.
* If you hover your mouse over each combat participant health bar in boarding screen, you can see his/her/its equipment.
* Small guns shoots more often, thus they are better designed for destroying small enemy ships (harder to hit). Also, if you have less experienced gunners, it is better to use smaller guns and explosive ammo to get higher chance to hit.</entry>
 <entry index="crafts" title=" 7. Crafting">{u}Setting crafting orders{/u}
    To start manufacturing items, first you must have enough material, proper module installed on ship and proper tool in ship cargo or in designed crew member inventory. Then you must set proper crafting order in {b}Craft{/b} menu and give crew member order to start crafting. What ship module and which items are needed for crafting, you can check in crafting menu (key {GameKey 15}). If you don't have items or workplace needed for crafting, they will be written in red in selected recipe information. Each recipe have own crafting time after which item is created, but crafter gains experience in crafting skill each 15 minutes. If after creating item, you don't have enough materials or tools to craft next item, crew member going on break and crafting order is cleared.
For crafting items you can set how many times you want to craft it. For studying items, you may choice only workshop.
Grayed name of recipe on list mean that you don't have enough material, proper tool or proper module installed thus you can't craft that recipe.

{u}Getting new crafting recipes{/u}
    At beginning of game, you know only few basic crafting recipes. To discover more, you must study item which crafting recipe you want to reveal. Studying works in similar way like normal crafting order - with two differences: studying take always one item to finish and it is always executed in Alchemy Lab module. List of available study orders depends on items which you have in ship cargo. Studying items doesn't give any materials, only crafting recipe.
    Additionally, you can buy crafting recipes in bases. Which recipes are available, depends on base type and known recipes. If you don't have option {b}&quot;Buy recipes&quot;{/b} in orders menu when docked to base, this mean you bought or know all available recipes in that base type.

{u}Deconstructing items{/u}
    Some items can be deconstructed to recover some materials used to create them. Each deconstruction takes place in an Alchemy Lab. Not all items can be deconstructed - especially this smallest can't. Generally, deconstruction take same amount of time like creating the item and in exchange it give around 80% of materials used in creating process.

{u}Crafting tips{/u}
* Crafter always use tool which he/she have currently equipped. If he/she don't have any equipped, he/she take it from own inventory or from ship cargo. You may set manually which tool to use by equipping it in crew member inventory screen.
* Each tool have chance to be damaged during crafting. Chance on damage tool depends on tool and crafting skill.
* Crafting skills and level of damage of workplace determine amount of manufactured items. More damaged modules causes less crafted items.
* Each crafting module have separated crafting order. This mean, you can produce few types of items (or few times this same item) in this same time, if you have few crafting modules installed on ship and all have assigned work orders and workers.

<entry index="repair" title=" 8. Repair/Upgrade ship">{u}Self repair of ship{/u}
   To start repairing ship, you must assign crew member to repair duty. If you don't have available {b}'Repair'{/b} order, it means, you don't have materials needed for repair module. You may assign more than one crew member or give order to repair for whole crew. Each additional member assigned made repair faster. Each damaged (or destroyed) module need specific material to repair and repair tools for each member assigned to repair duty. You can check which material is needed in {i}ship info{/i} screen. Ship is repaired every 15 minutes of work of assigned crew members. Speed of repairs depends on skills of assigned crew. You can check which skills are used in ship info screen.

{u}Repair ship in bases{/u}
   Additionally, you can buy repairs of ship in bases. Available options depends on size of base. In all bases you can select one module to repair or order slow repair of whole ship. In medium bases, you can order normal repair of whole ship and in large bases, fast repair. Normal and fast repairs cost more {MoneyName}. Base cost of repair depends on how much damaged is module and price of repair material in selected base.
   Cost of repairs is much lower in {shipyard} type bases.

{u}Upgrading ship modules{/u}
   To start upgrading ship modules you must first set which module you want to upgrade. You can do this in {i}ship info{/i} screen. Each module may have upgraded durability and some modules have additional options to upgrade (for example, guns have option to upgrade damage). If there no options to upgrade selected module, you may reached maximum allowed upgrade level for this module. To upgrading you need materials (it is that same material which is needed for repair module), repair tools in your ship cargo (or designed crew member inventory) and set crew member order to upgrade module. At this point it start slowly upgrading selected ship module. Each upgrade take some time and materials.
Speed of module upgrade depends on skill of assigned crew member (it is this same skill which is used to repair module). Additionally, better skill of assigned crew member can reduce material usage for ship modules upgrades.
You can always change which module and what is upgrading on it. If you change module to upgrade, all your progress is saved and can be continued later. If you change only what to upgrade (for example, from damage to durability) you will lose all previous upgrade progress.
You can always stop current module upgrade. It don't cause any loses to upgrade progress, you can resume upgrade at any time.
Each upgraded module gains some weight. Amount of gain depends on base module weight, its durability and upgrade type.

{u}Installing or removing ship modules{/u}
   In {shipyard} bases you can install new modules or remove old from ship. Availability of the modules to install depends on your reputation in the selected base. Each installation/removing take some time. Installation cost {MoneyName}, removing modules gives you {MoneyName}. There is some limitations to installation/removing modules: you can only replace ship hull module, you can have only one armor, cockpit, battering ram module installed on your ship. If you want replace armor, cockpit or battering ram, first you must remove old module from ship.
How much you get {MoneyName} from removing module depends on damage of selected module. If is it destroyed, removing will take only time and give no {MoneyName}.
Each ship hull have maximum module space and maximum allowed size of module, which limit what and how much modules can be installed on it. Armor and weapons don't count to this limit. Most of basic modules use only one module space, but this most expensive modules, may use a lot of space. You can check how much each module space use on {i}ship info{/i} screen or in {shipyard} screen in bases.</entry>
 <entry index="crew" title=" 9. Ship crew">{u}Hunger and thirst{/u}
    Depending on your character faction (selected at starting game), you and your crew must eat and drink. If you don't have food or drink on board, your crew will slowly die from dehydration or starvation. Amount of reduced hunger/thirst depends on consumables - more expensive consumables can restore more.

{u}Morale{/u}
   Every crew member (except this from {nomorale} factions) have morale. When he/she resting, he/she slowly gaining it (only when morale level is low), every time when he/she back to work, he/she losing a bit morale. Same with giving orders: giving new orders except resting, reduce morale a little. Very high level of fatigue cause morale lost either. If member morale is very low, he/she may refuse to obey orders. Low morale reduces crew member loyalty too. If crew member loyalty will be low he/she stop obey orders and may left your crew anytime you dock to base. In other way, high morale raises crew member loyalty.
If crew member can't find food or drink when he/she is hungry or thirsty, will be losing morale too. Some consumed food and drinks can affects morale either.
Each crew member must be paid. It may be daily payment - constant value of {MoneyName} paid on new day or percent of profit from selling items in bases or to traders. If you don't have enough {MoneyName} to pay, unpaid crew member will lose morale.
When your crew member die, you will stay with his/her body in your ship cargo. At this moment, you can only drop that body from cargo. Additionally, all other crew members lose some morale.
How fast crew member gains or lose morale depends on level of morale too: With higher level it gain and lose slower than when his/her morale is low. {fanaticism} members gains morale faster and lose it much slower.

{u}Tiredness{/u}
   Every member of crew (except this from {nofatigue} factions) getting tired when have assigned order other than {b}On break{/b} or {b}Talking in bases{/b}. When member is too tired, he/she stops working and going rest (only outside combat). After rest, if his/her previous position is vacant (e.g. nobody piloting ship), he/she automatically back to work if no other crew member on that position.
To assign selected crew member to position, select it from list by left click and then left click again on member order to select other.

{u}Health{/b}
    Crew members can regenerate health over time but only when they are on break and have assigned cabin. Additionally, if you have proper healing tools in cargo, you can assign other crew member to heal wounded. Assigning crew members in {b}Crew Info{/b} screen, don't assign that member to medical room (if you have any installed). To assign medic to medical room, you have to go to {b}Ship info{/b} screen. It can greatly speed up recovering (speed of healing depends on healing skill of healer). Having installed {b}medical room{/b} on ship speed up healing too. Only fully healed members can be healer. If you don't have any healing tools on ship, you can heal wounded crew members in bases. Cost of healing depends mostly on price of healing tools in selected base. In {temple} bases, healing is twice times cheaper than in other types of sky bases. Healing tools and healing skill needed for healing wounded, depends on faction of wounded crew member.

{u}Training skills{/u}
You may train selected crew member in any skill in bases. Each training session takes 60 minutes and gives some experience in trained skill and associated attribute. Cost of training depends on skill level. Gained experience depends on associated attribute. Additionally, if you have installed any training room module on your ship, you can train skills there. First, you must set which skill you want to train in this training room in {b}Ship Info{/b} screen. In that case, you need proper tools to train selected skill. Which tools are needed for each skill, you can check in {b}Crew Info{/b} screen. Then give selected crew member order to train.

{u}Orders priorities{/u}
   Each crew member can have set orders priorities. {b}Highest{/b} priority means that this crew member will be stop current work and go on selected order if that position is needed and vacant. {b}Normal{/b} priority means that this crew member will take selected position when he/she is on break if that position is needed and vacant. {b}None{/b} means that this crew member will be ignore selected position if that position is needed and vacant.
To set orders priorities, click button {b}'Set orders priorities'{/b} and select priority, then left click on priority level to change it.

{u}Various info{/u}
* If crew member cabin is destroyed (or don't have any) and he/she going on break, he/she will try find empty cabin as a new own to rest.
* Speed of rest of crew members depends on quality, damage level and cleanliness of cabin which they owned. Without cabin, they rest very slow.
* If your ship is docked to base, you can dismiss crew members. Go to crew info screen and use {b}Dismiss{/b} option on selected crew member. Dismissed crew members joins to base population. Dismissing crew member little reduces morale of rest of crew (if they are not from {nomorale} factions).
* Hunger, thirst, wounds, very low and very high morale (except for members of {nomorale} factions) have impact on your crew members skills. Wounded or hungry crew members have penalties to their skills.
* When crew member start working on duty which needs any tool (like crafting, cleaning, upgrading or repairing ship) he/she takes needed tool to own inventory and equipping it if he/she don't have proper tool equipped. You can manually set which tool he/she should use in inventory screen.
* Each crew member have maximum encumbrance for inventory which depends on his/her {StrengthName}.
* Crew members skills levels, starting from lowest: {i}Beginner, Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner, Competent, Respected, Renowned, Master, Grand-Master, Legendary, Ultimate{/i}.
* Crew members attributes levels, starting from lowest: {i}Very low, Low, Below average, Average, Above average, High, Very high, Outstanding{/i}.
* Each skill is associated with one attribute. It means that real skill level is sum of skill level and associated attribute level. Gaining experience in skill cause gaining experience in associated attribute too. Attributes levels grows much slower than skills levels. Additionally, if you gain experience in any skill, you gain experience in {ConditionName} too.
* If contract of crew member will ends, he/she will be treated like passenger (you can't give orders to that crew member anymore) and will leave your ship in next not abandoned base to which you dock. Until this, you must still feed him/her with food and drinks.</entry>
 <entry index="missions" title="10. Missions">{u}Starting missions{/u}
    You can ask for missions in bases where you have reputation level Unknown or above. Each base offers different missions - they amount depends on base size (in bigger bases you can get more missions) and on player reputation in that base (better reputation, more missions available). To see what missions are available in selected base, first you must dock to it then select option {b}Missions{/b} from {b}Orders{/b} menu (key {GameKey 14}). How many missions you can accept in base, depends on your reputation - with higher level, you can get more missions. You may reduce amount of money for reward for selected mission in exchange to earn more reputation in base. But one warning: if you fail that missions, you will lose more reputation either. To do this, move slider below mission info to the left. If you want more money but less reputation for mission, move slider to the right.
{b}Note:{/b} Information about estimated time to achievement (ETA) and approximately fuel usage is based on your ship full speed and fuel consumption by your engines. It may be different than final usage and time spend on mission.

{u}Some details about different types of missions{/u}
- {b}Deliver items{/b}: you don't need to dock to base to finish this mission, you can select proper order before docking. But you must have someone assigned to 'Talk in bases' position. Additionally, deliver missions gives reputation to both bases (base where mission was started and base where mission was ended).
- {b}Transport passengers{/b}: generally similar to {b}Deliver items{/b} missions - gives reputation to both bases, etc. Passengers are special crew members - you can't assign them to work, you can't change they cabin. They need food and drinks during transport. Same as normal crew members they can die during combat if they cabin will be destroyed. Each passenger always demands whole cabin for self.
- {b}Patrol{/b} or {b}Explore area{/b}: If you been attacked by enemy during exploring or patrolling, after fight you need to patrol or explore area again (again select proper order from {b}Orders{/b} menu).
- {b}Destroy ship{/b}: Same as {b}Patrol area{/b} - if you been attacked by other ship during searching for target, first you must finish this fight before you can start search again. If you escape from fight with mission target, you been need to search for it again.

{u}Finishing missions{/u}
   To finish mission, you must fly to map cell where mission target is and from {b}Orders{/b} menu (key {GameKey 14}) select proper order (for example, for patrol missions, you must select order {b}'Patrol area'{/b}). After some game time mission will be finished (for {i}delivery{/i} or {i}transport passengers{/i} missions) or ready to finish (any other type of missions). In second case, you must back to base from which you accepted mission to receive reward for it.
Amount of {MoneyName} for a mission depends on distance which you must fly to complete mission, type of mission and amount of free space in your ship cargo. Additionally, same as in trading, final award for finishing missions depends on assigned as trader crew member skill {TalkingSkill} and your reputation in the base. If you don't have free space in cargo ship, you don't get reward for mission.
Amount of reputation gained for finished mission or lost for failed mission depends on (same as amount of money) distance you must fly to complete mission and type of mission.
If you successfully finish mission, your character gain some morale, if you fail, he/she will lose some morale.

{u}Various info{/u}
* Red color of cabin quality in {i}Transport passengers{/i} missions in {b}Available Missions{/b} menu means you don't have installed cabin with that quality or higher on ship. Yellow means you have cabin with that quality or higher but it is taken by someone else.
* Each mission have time limit - if you don't finish mission in that time, mission will fail. {i}Delivery{/i} mission will fail too if you drop mission item from your cargo. {i}Transport passengers{/i} mission will fail if you dismiss passenger from your ship. If you fail mission, you lose some reputation with that base.
* You can see all accepted missions in {b}Missions{/b} menu (key {GameKey 19}). There you can set mission target map cell as destination for your ship.</entry>
 <entry index="recruit" title="11. Hiring crew members">{u}General info{/u}
    You can hire new crew members in bases. First you must dock to base, then you choice {b}Recruit{/b} option from {b}Orders{/b} menu. Amount of available recruits depends on size of base, but in some bases ({barracks}) there is more recruits and they are cheaper. They hire cost and future payment, depends on amount of knowledge (amount of skills and attributes and levels of skills and attributes) and equipment. Skills, amount of skills, attributes and equipment quality of recruits depends on your reputation in selected base, but from time to time, you can find very experienced recruits in bases too.

{u}Negotiating employment{/u}
   When you start negotiations, you can change future payments and length of contract with recruit to raise or lower hiring price. If you offer higher payments, hire cost will be lower. If you offer lower payments than recruit expected, you been need to pay him/her more for join your crew. Default price is for permanent contract with that recruit. If you choice shorter period of time, you will pay much less for hiring it.

{u}Tips{/u}
* Here no limit how much crew members you can have on ship, just remember, all of them needs food, drinks, place to rest and payment.
* Hiring new crew members reduce population of base. New recruits are available every 30 days between visits of base.
* Starting morale of recruit depends on player reputation in selected base, except members of {nomorale} factions.</entry>
 <entry index="tips" title="12. Tips">* All shortcuts from game menu works on map screen too, even when game menu is hidden. For example: you can always see help by press {GameKey 22} key on sky map (no need to press {GameKey 26} first to show menu).
* If you want travel faster (for example, for escape from fight), you can drop some items from your cargo. Go to cargo information screen, select desired item and select proper option from item options menu.
* Each crew member need proper module for work. If that module is destroyed, member cannot start selected work (for example, can't start piloting when cockpit is destroyed).
* You can assign crew members to selected module (cabins, guns, workplaces) on ship info screen. All workplaces first must have set crafting order, before you can assign someone.
* You can reduce how long disease affect selected base by delivering medicines to it. Which exactly medical supplies are needed depends on faction which belongs base. If you choice deliver supplies for free, you can gain some reputation otherwise, you gain {MoneyName} and may lose some reputation.
* What enemy you meet depends on how much upgraded ship you have - especially on upgrades of hull, armor, weapons and type of ammo. At beginning of game you can meet weakest enemies, with every ship upgrade you meet stronger. Of course, there is always small chance that you encounter enemy stronger than you.
* Each enemy can be different: very often enemy ships have some modules upgrades installed (stronger version of weapon, more durability, etc).
* Which orders are available for crew members, depends on orders prerequisites. For example, if you don't have set any crafting order set, you can't assign crew member to manufacturing.
* Your ship gets dirty at the start of every day. You can send as many crew members as you want to clean the ship or give an order to the whole crew. It is the only order which don't give any experience to assigned crew members. You need any type of bucket to execute this order.

* You may set some game options during play by selecting 'Game Options' menu (key {GameKey 23}). Changes done to options are used in current and each next game.
* If you deliver proper medical supplies for free to diseased base, you gain some reputation in that base. If you sell medical supplies to diseased base, you earn some money but lose reputation. The amount of gained or lost reputation depends on how much medical supplies you gave or sold.
* You can check the progress of your character goal in 'Game statistics' menu (key {GameKey 21}). There you can change it too, but if you do it, progress of old goal will be lost. If you finish your current goal, a new random goal will be given.
* Abandoned bases may be recovered by someone. In that situation, they gain a small population and a new owner.
* You may move most items (with exception of items needed for missions) between ship cargo and crew members inventory in cargo screen and from inventory to ship in selected crew member inventory screen.
* Enemies during combat can send boarding parties to your ship too, so when you are caught by a harpoon (or you caught an enemy by your harpoon), don't forget to set someone to defends ship.
* During combat with undead ships, it is good to send boarding party on enemy ship. After combat they may find interesting thing...
* Your career determine not only your starting ship and crew, but mainly gaining experience by you and your crew members in skills during game. Those who choice combat based career will be learn combat skills faster than those who choice crafting based career.
* When you waiting in place outside sky bases, your ship will be use fuel too. Watch out on it, because if you will not have enough fuel, you may fall from sky and die.
* You may "zoom in" or "zoom out" map with mouse wheel, while holding SHIFT key (it changing size of font used for map) or with {GameKey 28} and {GameKey 29} keys.
* You may change all keyboard shortcuts in 'Game Options' menu (key {GameKey 23}).</entry>
